# Purpose and Objectives

## Objectives of Threat Intelligence

In the context of our SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) framework, the objectives of threat intelligence are as follows:

- **Enhance Incident Detection**: Leverage threat intelligence to proactively identify and detect security threats and vulnerabilities within our organization's environment.
  
- **Improve Incident Response**: Utilize threat intelligence to enhance our incident response capabilities, enabling faster and more effective responses to security incidents.

- **Prioritize Threats**: Employ threat intelligence to prioritize security threats based on their severity, potential impact, and relevance to our organization.

- **Inform Decision-Making**: Provide actionable insights and intelligence to support informed decision-making processes related to cybersecurity operations and risk management.

## Specific Goals and Outcomes

By leveraging threat intelligence within our SOAR framework, we aim to achieve the following specific goals and outcomes:

- **Early Threat Detection**: Detect and identify emerging threats and indicators of compromise (IOCs) before they escalate into security incidents.

- **Reduced Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Decrease the time taken to detect and respond to security threats by automating threat intelligence analysis and correlation.

- **Enhanced Incident Response Efficiency**: Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of incident response efforts through the timely and targeted application of threat intelligence.

- **Improved Security Posture**: Strengthen our organization's overall security posture by proactively identifying and mitigating potential security risks and vulnerabilities.

# Sources of Threat Intelligence

## Various Sources Utilized

In our threat intelligence strategy, we utilize a combination of diverse sources to gather relevant information about cybersecurity threats. These sources include:

- **Open-Source Feeds**: Leveraging publicly available threat feeds, forums, and communities to gather intelligence on known threats, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques.

- **Commercial Vendors**: Subscribing to commercial threat intelligence services and platforms that provide curated feeds, threat reports, and analysis tailored to our organization's needs.

- **Internal Data Sources**: Utilizing internal security logs, event data, and incident reports generated from our security infrastructure and monitoring systems.

- **Government Agencies**: Monitoring threat intelligence reports and advisories issued by government agencies, law enforcement, and cybersecurity organizations.

## Contribution to Threat Intelligence Strategy

Each source of threat intelligence contributes uniquely to our overall strategy by providing valuable insights and information. Here's how:

- **Open-Source Feeds**: Offer a wide range of publicly available threat data, including IOCs, malware signatures, threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and security advisories.

- **Commercial Vendors**: Provide curated threat intelligence feeds, reports, and analysis with a focus on relevance, accuracy, and timeliness. Offer additional services such as threat hunting, incident response support, and threat actor attribution.

- **Internal Data Sources**: Offer insights into the organization's specific threat landscape, including internal network activity, user behavior, system logs, and incident data. Enable customized analysis and correlation of threat intelligence with internal security events and incidents.

- **Government Agencies**: Provide authoritative threat intelligence reports, advisories, and alerts based on national and global cybersecurity trends, incidents, and threat actor activity. Offer insights into geopolitical factors, regulatory developments, and emerging threats relevant to our organization.
