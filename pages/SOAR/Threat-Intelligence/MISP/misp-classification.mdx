# Understanding Tags and Taxonomy in MISP

MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed to aid in the sharing, storage, and analysis of threat intelligence data. One of the key features of MISP is its flexible tagging system and taxonomy, which allows users to categorize and classify information in a structured and standardized manner.

## Tags in MISP

Tags in MISP are used to provide metadata about various elements within the platform, such as events, attributes, objects, and galaxies. Tags serve several purposes, including:

- **Categorization**: Tags help categorize and classify information based on various criteria, such as threat type, malware family, or attack technique.
- **Filtering and Searching**: Users can use tags to filter and search for specific information within MISP, making it easier to find relevant data.
- **Enrichment**: Tags can enrich the context of information by providing additional metadata or context.

### Types of Tags

MISP supports different types of tags, including:

- **Galaxy Tags**: These tags are used to reference external threat intelligence sources, such as MITRE ATT&CK, CAPEC, or malware classification systems.
- **Taxonomy Tags**: Taxonomy tags are used to categorize information based on predefined taxonomies, such as the MISP galaxy taxonomy, which includes categories like threat actors, malware families, and attack patterns.
- **User-Defined Tags**: Users can create custom tags to suit their organization's specific needs or to provide additional context to the information they share.

## Taxonomy in MISP

Taxonomy refers to the hierarchical classification of information based on predefined categories and relationships. In MISP, taxonomy is used to organize and structure threat intelligence data in a standardized manner, facilitating interoperability and information sharing among different organizations and platforms.

### MISP Galaxy Taxonomy

The MISP galaxy taxonomy is a comprehensive classification system used to categorize various aspects of threat intelligence. It includes several galaxies, each focusing on a specific area of cybersecurity, such as threat actors, malware, tools, and techniques. The taxonomy is structured hierarchically, with each galaxy containing clusters and elements representing different entities related to that category.

#### Example Galaxies:

- **Threat Actors**: Contains information about known threat actor groups, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and associated indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Malware**: Provides information about different malware families, their characteristics, capabilities, and associated IOCs.
- **Tools**: Describes various tools and utilities used by threat actors, such as exploit kits, remote access Trojans (RATs), and reconnaissance tools.
- **Techniques**: Covers common attack techniques and tactics used by threat actors, as documented in frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.

### Benefits of Taxonomy

The use of taxonomy in MISP offers several benefits:

- **Standardization**: Taxonomy provides a standardized framework for organizing and categorizing threat intelligence data, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different organizations and platforms.
- **Interoperability**: By adhering to a common taxonomy, organizations can easily share and exchange threat intelligence data with partners, vendors, and other stakeholders.
- **Granularity**: Taxonomy allows for fine-grained classification of information, enabling users to drill down into specific categories and subcategories to better understand and analyze threats.
- **Contextualization**: Taxonomy tags provide additional context and enrichment to threat intelligence data, helping analysts make more informed decisions and take appropriate actions.

## Conclusion

Tags and taxonomy play a crucial role in organizing, categorizing, and analyzing threat intelligence data within the MISP platform. By leveraging tags and adhering to standardized taxonomy frameworks like the MISP galaxy taxonomy, organizations can improve their ability to identify, prioritize, and mitigate cybersecurity threats effectively.
