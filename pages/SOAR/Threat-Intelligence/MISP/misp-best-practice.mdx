# Best Practices in Threat Intelligence with MISP

## Overview

The MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing) Project provides a robust platform for gathering, documenting, analyzing, and contextualizing threat intelligence data. This MDX file summarizes best practices in threat intelligence leveraging MISP.

## Objectives

- Learn how to utilize MISP for common OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) gathering use-cases.
- Improve data models in MISP by exchanging live improvements and ideas.
- Share the results with the community.
- Utilize practical exercises based on recent cases to model and structure intelligence using the MISP standard.

## (Threat) Intelligence

- Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) encompasses various concepts, methods, and workflows.
- MISP allows flexibility in intelligence modeling to suit organizational objectives.
- Pre-defined knowledge bases and data models are available in MISP.

## Meta Information and Contextualization

- Quality indicators are crucial, but tagging and classification are equally important.
- MISP utilizes tags from taxonomy libraries for organizing intelligence.
- Galaxies provide a vast set of common libraries for contextualization.

## Estimative Probability

- Estimative language proposes clear wording for estimating probability.
- MISP's estimative-language taxonomy offers an applied model for tagging information.

## Reliability, Credibility, and Confidence

- The Admiralty Scale (NATO System) ranks source reliability and information credibility.
- MISP's admiralty-scale taxonomy assists in ranking reliability.
- US DoD JP 2-0 includes confidence assessment guidelines, available in MISP.

## Adding Attributes/Objects to an Event

- Single atomic elements are represented with attributes.
- Choosing the right attribute type is critical.
- Composite information is represented with objects.

## How to Select the Right Object?

- MISP offers over 150 object templates.
- Object selection depends on the use case and data complexity.

## Examples of MISP Objects

### Microblog Object

- Use case: Structuring OSINT tweets from a security researcher.
- Object: Microblog object for tweets or microblog posts.

### File Object

- Use case: Describing file samples received via email or extracted from VirusTotal.
- Object: File object for describing files and associated metadata.
